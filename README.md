Ali Baba heard about a new cave to be robbed, so he needs to assemble his team of thieves to do the
job, some thieves need to be paid to go with him, some might pay money just to be with Ali Baba, others
don't get paid or pay.
Anyway, the thieves sit in a long line and Ali Baba has to choose a group of them and this group should
cost him as minimum as possible, where thieves who get paid cost him +ve LE, those who pay him to
come cost him -ve LE, and the others cost him nothing 0 LE
But, he can't select from them except 1 group of consecutive thieves, like he can say I want all the
thieves between the thief number 3 and the thief number 8, so his group would be the thieves 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 and 8, adding the costs of each one will lead to the total cost of this group.
